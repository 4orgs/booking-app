Laravel web application for booking appointments

## Hello!
This is an open-source web application designed to allow users to book an appointment. This is very much a work in progress, but the end product will:
***
 - Take into account time for each 'package' to be completed, ensuring no appointment overlapping will be possible
 - Implement a robust Administrator interface to easily select the dates and times that are available for appointments
 - Store user information (WITH THEIR PERMISSION) in order to create a database for mailing out newsletters and deals

This is very much a work in progress, but I will be working on this as often as I can in my spare time ( In between work and ranking up in CS:GO ;) )


I encourage and appreciate any feedback related to this app. I am not currently aware of the full scope of the application, but I plan on making it easily customizable to anyone's needs.
